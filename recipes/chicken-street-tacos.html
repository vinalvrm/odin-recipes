    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A taco is a traditional Mexican food consisting of a small hand-sized corn- or wheat-based tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is then folded around the filling and eaten by hand.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound pollo para asar (seasoned, boneless, skinless chicken)</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>8 corn tortillas</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Grill chicken, turning occasionally, until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer, inserted near the center, should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat corn tortillas until soft and pliable in the microwave, about 1 minute. Top with chicken, onions, and cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
